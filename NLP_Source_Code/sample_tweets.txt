@JayMeye88926975 @not_onions @JoeBiden Biden is a Hitler. I saw his heart during the speech. He has a heart only for evil not for good.
@pamelaj01101616 @PrincessIn2012 @primrose1508 @JoeBiden Well Diane, if all you can drum up is old issues from a year &amp; a half ago then Biden must be doing a good job if you can’t find any complaints about the present.

Ending today on a high note. Celebrating #NationalCinemaDay at my local @Cinemark with #NoWayHome. Also first time being in an XD theater. Really excited for this.

The #NoWayHome extended edition is fun. Lot of what they cut was kinda dumb but you know what? Who cares. Chance to see arguably the best MCU movie again on the big screen? Take it.
